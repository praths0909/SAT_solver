# How to run
We have implemented using c++ language.  
The input will be taken from `input.cnf`.  
The output will be shown in     `output.txt`  
To compile it  ` g++ sol.cpp`  
To run it `./a.out`  
These all are for linux system.  
## For Test Cases
Go into the `test_cases/testcase{x}` folder in terminal and type   
`g++ ../../sol.cpp` to compile  
`./a.out` to run  
The expected answer of each test case is in `answer.txt` file.
The input will be taken from `input.cnf`.  
The output will be shown in     `output.txt`
